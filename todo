TODO:
- Fix the hosting script to redirect logs to a file
- Update docs to reflect the new build and hosting process
- Prettify the live leaderboard page
	- When a user submits, their box turns into a ? and then updates with their score
	- If they go up a place, it plays an animation showing them moving up
- potentially put submissions in /tmp instead of the problem dir
- rate limit submissions per user
