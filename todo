TODO:
- Timer/countdown on the main contest page
- Make a live leaderboard page
	- When a user submits, their box turns into a ? and then updates with their score
	- If they go up a place, it plays an animation showing them moving up
- Add some kind of order of problems to the leaderboard (order them by difficulty?)
- Logging out doesn't actually log you out
- potentially put submissions in /tmp instead of the problem dir
